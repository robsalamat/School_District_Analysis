# School_District_Analysis

## I. Overview of Project

### Background
Maria, the chief data scientist of the city school district, was tasked with analyzing data on student funding and standardized test scores in order to showcase trends and pattern.

### Objective

Now, the goal is to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact, then repeat the school district analysis and report how the changes affected the overall analysis.
